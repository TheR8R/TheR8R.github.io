This project contains the prototype made for my bachelors project. 

It is accessible on https://ther8r.github.io/.

The prototype is a proof of concept to show that echolocation could be used in a virtual environment to convey information
about the room and was made for blind and low vision people to try. We gathered feedback through a questionaire and found that
echolocation could indeed be used, but more testing and further development is needed to better and perfect the implementation.
